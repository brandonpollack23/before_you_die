# Requisite functionality
* [ ] some way to represent ordering in list view
* [ ] Compose based UI for desktop/web/android
  * [ ] List View
    * [ ] Whether blocked or not
    * [ ] Completed expandable gutter
  * [ ] Graph view (should i roll this? Use graphviz as an svg generator? How can i make it all clickable then)
* [ ] Syncing to a database
  * [ ] Self-hosted
  * [ ] Cloud based solution that is easy to spin up/sign up
  * [ ] Firebase solution (this would actually replace sqlite altogether)
* [ ] (optionally if compose doesnt work) SwiftUI based UI for iOS
* 
# High Level Ideas
* [ ] Multiple Lists/Graphs that can be chosen between (like seperate keep notes) (I can do this with an extra column in the db for list id, and a list table for names)
* [ ] Multiview mode that merges all the lists into one actionable items list

# Documentation
* [ ] A better graph structure example in the readme, perhaps a screenshot
